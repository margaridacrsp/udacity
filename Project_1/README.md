In this project we are looking to Seattle's AirBnB listings and answering the following questions: <br /> 
 Question 1: Does Seattle has the type and number of accommodations you need? <br /> 
 Question 2: When is the best time of year to visit Seattle? What is the average price per day? <br /> 
 Question 3: What are the most expensive zones in Seattle? Does the higher priced locations have best scores? <br /> 
For the last question was also used the QGis software to explore the results obtained. <br />
